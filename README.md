# Fibonacci Sequence
## This sequence requires you to take the current number and add it with the previous number.

# Difference between Loop and Recursion
## The loop is simple, simply add the two numbers then change them to the new number and the previous one. Then put them in a loop for about 18 times. The recursion is slightly difference since you need to put the code in a function and call it.

# Big O Algorithm
## A good data structure is one that can compute a lot of elements with a small amount of opperations to save time and memory.
